    introduction: `Kailash hostel indeed consists of students filled with enthusiasm and hostel spirit. There's a constant urge for everyone to be a part and take the culture in Kailash to great heights. Be it the BHM trophy, BRCA trophy, BSA, BSP,  Kailash has year over year proven to be worthy and has given a fierce front. The sigil painting, beautifully decorating the back entrance of Kailash won the first prize. Not only this, Kailash stood second in BHM trophy in 2019 (confirm year) and xyz in BSP trophy.

    Each and every resident of Kailash has contributed to this journey and has been a part and parcel of these achievements. The participation from Kailash increased tremendously not just in terms of numbers but also in terms of people becoming aware of their talents through regular workshops and intra-hostels events
    This development is not just seen on the cultural front, but also in terms of infrastructure and the consciousness among residents.  The foundation of a brimming sports culture has been set up in the last 5 years. A badminton court, a basketball court, a gym,  development of Kailash Activity Center (KAC, analogous to indoor sports room) with TT table, carrom and other indoor games, other sports equipments of optimum quality are a few developments (kuch change krte h word)  Kailash has proudly made during these years.
    
    On the cultural front, Kailash now has a fully air conditioned dance room, a music room and computer room. The visitors room has been upgraded with new furniture! Not just that, Kailash has its own library. Now students do not have to be a part of the hustle of grabbing a seat at the library. Also, the parlour of Kailash is a lifesaver at times of need.
    
    With the new guidelines being enforced, the maintenance issues have been resolved with two dustbins for wet and dry waste everywhere, hand wash in washroom & soap holders in bathrooms. And how can one forget about Kamlesh bhaiya's juice shop, which now serves fruit chats, delicious sandwiches, finger licking poha and everyone's all time favourite Maggi. Kuldeep Bhaiya's shop is now no less than a supermarket now with all the utilities available right at a 50 meter distance for students
